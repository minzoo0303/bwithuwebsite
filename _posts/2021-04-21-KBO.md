# League composition

The pennant race, in which 10 teams participate, is held at the end of March every yearIt starts in early April and ends as early as October or at the end of October at the latest. Each team will play 144 games, half of which, 72 games, will be played at each team's home stadium, and the remaining 72 games will be played away. In the opening game, the top five teams will have the authority to host home games in five consecutive games of the first opening series based on the final ranking two seasons before the season.

As of 2022, the pennant race starts at 6:30 p.m. from Tuesday to Friday regardless of the season, and sometimes at 7 p.m. at the discretion of each club on Friday. The start time of the competition on weekends and holidays varies from season to season. First of all, the opening match on Saturday and Children's Day on May 5 will be held at 2 p.m. unconditionally. Sunday's game starts at 2 p.m. from the opening series to the last week of May, from the first Sunday of September to the end of the pennant race. Saturday's game (except for the opening game) starts at 5 p.m. from next week of the opening series to the last Saturday of June. In July and August, which are classified as hot weather, Saturday's game starts at 6 p.m. and Sunday's game starts at 5 p.m. Holiday matches during the pennant race will start at 2 p.m. from the opening series to the last week of May, 5 p.m. from June to the last week of August, and 2 p.m. from September to the end of the pennant race. The KBO postseason will be played at 6:30 p.m. on weekdays and at 2 p.m. on Saturdays, Sundays and holidays. Uniquely, on the day of Chuseok, Jamsil alone will play at 2 p.m. and the other four stadiums, including Gocheok, will play at 5 p.m.

The season ranking in the league is calculated in the order of winning rates, and the top five teams will advance to the KBO postseason in the order of winning rates. In a situation where the teams that advance to the postseason are determined, the ranking match will be played if there is a joint No. 1 team and a joint No. 5 team based on the winning rate by the end of the season.
