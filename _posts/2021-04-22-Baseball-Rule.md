## Baseball Rule -Basic 

**Baseball** is a game that in which two teams of nine players, led by a coach, are played in accordance with this rule under the supervision of one or more judges in a fenced stadium (if the designated hitter system is adopted, there will be 10 players).

**for game,** the attacking team must have the batter become the runner and advance the runner, and the defense team's purpose is to prevent the opponent's batter from becoming the runner and to prevent the runner from advancing.

**score** If the batter becomes a runner and reaches all bases normally, one point is scored for the team. Each team must score more than the other team to win, and at the end of the official game, the team that scores more points under this rule will be the winner.

### Strike Zone
![Strike Zone](https://cdn.spochoo.com/news/photo/202201/100524_201114_3256.jpg)

If a batter fails to hit the ball when it enters the strike zone, 
or if it becomes a foul, or if the ball passes through the zone as it is, 
the number of strikes rises, and one out count rises when it becomes three strikes.
