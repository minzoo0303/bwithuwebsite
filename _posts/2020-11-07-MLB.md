Major League Baseball (MLB) is a professional baseball league in the United States and Canada. It is the dream stage of all baseball players around the world and the best professional baseball league in the world.

It is commonly referred to as the MLB or the Big League, which is usually referred to as the Major League. The highest and most famous professional baseball league in the world and the dream league desired by many baseball players. The official site is MLB.com. There is a major league, so there is a minor league, so there is also a minor league, which contrasts with the major leagues.

It consists of the American League and the National League. A total of 30 teams are registered in the National League and 15 in the American League, with 29 teams based in the United States and only the Toronto Blue Jays based in Toronto, Canada. Until 2004, there were two teams in Canada (the Montreal Expos and the Toronto Blue Jays), but the Montreal Expos moved to Washington, reducing it to one. Anyway, since Canada is participating, it is officially the North American professional baseball league. So far, there have been only two Canadian teams, and now only one of them is left, so it is no different from American professional baseball. Therefore, in Korea, Major League Baseball is often referred to as American professional baseball. This is in contrast to the NHL, which has quite a few Canadian clubs and is very popular among Canadians.
