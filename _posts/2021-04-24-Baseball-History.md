Baseball is a bat-and-ball sport played between two teams of nine players each, taking turns batting and fielding. 
The game is live when the umpire signals to the pitcher either verbally or by pointing, indicating that the ball is now in play. 
A player on the fielding team, called the pitcher, throws a ball that a player on the batting team tries to hit with a bat. 
The objective of the offensive team (batting team) is to hit the ball into the field of play, away from the other team's players, allowing its players to run the bases, having them advance counter-clockwise around four bases to score what are called "runs". 
The objective of the defensive team (referred to as the fielding team) is to prevent batters from becoming runners, and to prevent runners' advance around the bases. 
A run is scored when a runner legally advances around the bases in order and touches home plate (the place where the player started as a batter).

# The Origin of Baseball
**: There are two theories about the origin of baseball.**

`< First : The Story of cricket >`

    In England early on, bat and small ball games were popular. 
    For example, four corners, feeders, and rounders, which British immigrants spread to the United States. 
    Prior to the American Revolutionary War in 1775, it was mainly practiced on the east coast, but was distributed and developed throughout the United States around the mid-19th century.
    The way the game was played at the time was simple.

    When the pitcher threw the ball, the batter hit it and ran to the base, 
    and the defender also ran toward the base as soon as he caught the ball. 
    If the defender reaches the base first, he is out, and if the batter reaches the base quickly, he is safe. 
    At that time, the number of players was not constant, and the position of the base was not set. 
    The base was designated by simply driving a stake or digging a hole. 
    Then, in 1830, a game called the town ball, which mimicked the Rounders, began in Boston. 
    Three years later, in 1833, a slightly different type of townball was prevalent in Philadelphia, 
    and at the same time in New York, and it was only said that it developed to become a base ball.

`< Second : Abner Doubleday's argument >`

    It is claimed that a soldier named Abner Doubleday created the first baseball game in New York in 1839. 
    According to the theory, there were two defenders between the first and second bases and the second and third bases, 
    and 11 players played as a team. However, this argument soon met with considerable objections.

    Some people laughed at Doubleday, saying it was just an application of the Rounders, 
    and records were also found that a movement called baseball was already in England before 1750. 
    Moreover, a picture book published in 1789 found an article titled Baseball with illustrations, 
    and the theory that Doubleday invented baseball on his own lost traction. 
    Anyway, baseball, which began to develop in earnest in the United States, gradually changed over time to what it is today. 
    The base was fixed around 1841, and the first baseball team, Knickerbockers, was formed in 1845, 
    and the stadium became the diamond form it is now. The following year, 1846, a nine-man rule was enacted, 
    and the first official baseball game was played between the Knickerbockers team and the New York Nine team that separated from it.
